This project implements Dijkstra's basic shortest path algorithm and 
some variants of it.

The project can be build by calling

	qmake spp_cpp.pro
(only when files have been changed) and afterwards:
	make release
or
	make debug
.

Some test calls are provided in the file test.sh.

Calling the program
===================

The program can be called as follows:

	./spp_cpp <in_file> -s <src> -t <target> <options>

Valid options are:
	-h		Dijkstra with binary heap
	-h -b 		... and bidirectional search
	-h -z 		... and goal-directed search
	-d		Dijkstra as proposed by Dial
	-d -b 		... with bidirectional search
	-d -z 		... with goal-directed search
	-a		comparison test running all of the above options
